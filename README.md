## Install

This website uses the [Hugo](https://github.com/spf13/hugo) static site
generator. If you are planning to contribute you'll want to download and install
Hugo on your local machine.

The installation of Hugo is out of the scope of this document, so please take
the [official install instructions](https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/) to
get Hugo up and running.


## Development

To generate the website and serve it on [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313)
just execute this command and stop it with `Ctrl+C`:

```
hugo server
```

When you are done with your changes just create a pull request, after merging
the pull request the website will be updated automatically.
